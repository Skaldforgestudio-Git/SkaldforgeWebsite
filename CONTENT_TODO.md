# CONTENT_TODO

Open items needing Skaldforge sign-off. Nothing here is currently published as
a claim : each item is omitted, disabled behind a flag, or flagged because it
was inferred rather than verified.

**Sources, newest first**
- `STUDIO` : studio-supplied current canon (chat direction). **Authoritative.**
- `FINAL` : *Final Presentation - Copy.pptx* (recovered from the OneDrive zip)
- `TRAILER` : *Mythbound_FinalTrailerV02.mp4*
- `ASG` : *Mythbound ASG.pptx* (slide numbers given)
- `GDD` : *Mythbound GDD.docx* v1.80 : **largely superseded, see below**

## 0. What is now treated as OBSOLETE

Per STUDIO direction, none of the following may appear on the site, and all
have been removed:

- **4v4** as a universal format · **3v3v3** · **1v1v1** · three-team Relic Rush
- **Hel as announcer** (Hel is Yrsa's sponsor; **Odin** is the announcer)
- The old three-Bound roster
- Older prototype abilities: Thunderous Advance, Thunderfall, Tidal Spear,
  Leviathan's Wake, Hex Recall, Soul Rend
- **Dash** and **grapple** as advertised core traversal
- Any description of Mythbound as a local multiplayer party game
- Ultimates : every Bound has exactly two abilities

The GDD remains the source only for build/height/movement-feel flavour and the
"contract and marked eyes" premise. Its mode, ability and roster sections are
dead.

## 1. Arena naming: resolved

The studio confirmed **Himinbjorg** on August 31, 2026. This matches FINAL
slide 6. Public copy, arena data and the image filename now use Himinbjorg.
No further naming decision is needed.

## 2. Skari's surname: resolved

The studio confirmed **Gravewind** on September 4, 2026. Skari and Yrsa are
sisters, so both share the surname, and the supplied character copy heading
Skari's section "Skari Gravewind" was correct rather than a typo.

The older **Skari Quickstep** in the GDD, ASG slide 20 and FINAL slide 5 is
superseded and must not be restored. Public copy and `src/data/bound.ts` now
use Skari Gravewind. No further naming decision is needed.

## 3. Skari's pronouns : changed

The supplied copy uses **she/her** for Skari ("her speed, cunning"). The GDD used
they/them. The site now uses she/her, per the newer source.

**Action:** confirm this is intentional and not an inconsistency.

## 4. Relic Rush : goals and lives

Two statements were supplied a few minutes apart:
1. "carry it into the enemy goal, costing the opposing team a life"
2. "protecting their own **three goals**. The relic destroys a goal upon entry.
   When a team loses every life, it can no longer respawn."

The site publishes (2), the later version: three goals, relic destroys a goal on
entry, lose all lives and you stop respawning, last team standing wins.

**Action:** confirm goals and lives are the same resource, or clarify the
relationship. `src/data/game.ts` → `relicRush`, `modes`.

## 5. Free For All player count

STUDIO gave "2-8 players" in one message and omitted it in the next. The site
publishes **2 to 8**.

**Action:** confirm. `src/data/game.ts` → `modes`.

## 6. Arena descriptions: resolved

The studio supplied lore for Himinbjorg, Helheim and Midgard on August 31, 2026.
Edited for brevity and published in the shared arena showcase on Home and Mythbound.
Asgard is mentioned only as the realm connected to Midgard through Himinbjorg,
not as an arena name. No additional map-layout claims are implied.

## 7. Defensive shield : described generically

Per STUDIO, no numeric shield behaviour is published. The Brawl pillar says
"parry timing" and "spacing" rather than durability or regeneration values.

**Action:** none required. Revisit only if you want the mechanic named publicly.

## 8. Setting : modern-day Norway de-emphasised

Per STUDIO, the alternate-modern-Norway framing was pulled back. The site now
leads with the gods, the sponsorship contract and the arena. The Valkyries are
no longer mentioned. The "contract and marked eyes" premise is retained because
every finished render visibly supports it.

**Action:** confirm the current narrative framing.

## 9. Gameplay clips carry a live HUD and dev names

The three mode clips (FINAL slides 7) are playtest captures. Visible on screen:
an FPS/ping debug readout, and real player names in scoreboards and kill feeds
(DanielDR, CaiusR, Jacob, RichardH, ChrisC, MichaelD, Abner, MichaelK).

This was kept deliberately : for a developer or Epic audience it reads as
evidence the game genuinely runs, and the section is labelled "captured from a
work-in-progress playtest build". But it does put team members' handles on a
public marketing site.

**Action:** confirm that is acceptable, or supply clean captures. Also listed as
ART_ASSET_CHECKLIST P1.

## 10. Team roster : BUILT BUT DISABLED

`src/data/studio.ts` holds the full roster from FINAL slide 3 with
`publishRoster = false`. The Studio page shows disciplines instead.

FINAL supersedes ASG here : it moves Level Design Lead from Kenzey Estes to
Michael Doctor and adds sound design and voice acting.

**Action:** confirm names, spellings and titles, then set `publishRoster = true`.

## 11. Social links and contact : PUBLISHED

Steam store page, Reddit, X, TikTok and LinkedIn are live in `src/data/site.ts`
(`steam`, `socials`). They appear in the nav (Wishlist on Steam), hero and
closing CTA buttons, the footer "Connect" column, the Studio and Contact pages,
and the Organization/VideoGame JSON-LD `sameAs`. Add new channels there only.

## 12. Release window: resolved for public copy

The PM confirmed the public target should read **TBA**. A Q4 2026 Early Access
window exists internally, but it is not presented as a public commitment. The
site identifies Mythbound as in post-production and refers to Early Access
without publishing a date.

## 13. Engine and technology claims: PM approved

The PM approved public coverage of **Unreal Engine 5.7**, **Gameplay Ability
System**, **Motion Matching** and **competitive multiplayer** for the Epic-facing
technology story. The Development page now focuses on those areas and uses
current gameplay clips instead of old blockouts, asset budgets or concept-art
pipeline material.

**Still not claimed:** Nanite, Lumen, Chaos, a specific networking architecture
or unconfirmed engine features.

**Update, September 3, 2026 (STUDIO):** the Development page toolchain section
was rebuilt around the full public Unreal and art stack: Blueprints, GAS,
CommonUI, Enhanced Input, StateTree, Niagara, PCG, **World Partition**,
Full-Body IK, Motion Matching and EOS, plus Unreal Insights for profiling.
World Partition is confirmed in use, specifically for streaming the visibility
of gameplay-relevant collision (mantle volumes, simple collision, etc.), not
for open-world streaming claims. The genre/engine/modes/perspective/status/
target-window snapshot grid was removed from this page only (`Snapshot`
usage removed from `technology.astro`; still shown on Home and Mythbound).
The Developer ViDoc video was replaced with an updated cut; same filename,
still captionless (video has burned-in captions per #15).

## 14. Generative-AI tools omitted from the public toolchain : CONFIRM

ASG slide 6 lists **Stable Diffusion**, **Hunyuan Studio** and **Hitem 3D**
alongside Maya, ZBrush and Substance. These are omitted from the published
toolchain : a public pipeline page aimed at an Epic reviewer invites provenance
questions the site cannot answer for you.

Separately, ASG `image65.png` is an AI-generated image with a visible generative
watermark. It is **not used anywhere**.

**Action:** decide whether to disclose. `src/data/tech.ts` → `toolchain`.

## 15. Video captions

The trailer's optional WebVTT captions now default off because the supplied
video already contains captions. The Developer ViDoc is also confirmed to have
captions in the video and is published on the Development page.

## 16. FIEA / UCF origin wording

The Studio page states Skaldforge formed out of UCF's Florida Interactive
Entertainment Academy. This comes from the original brief only.

**Action:** approve, or disable via `src/data/studio.ts` → `origin.show = false`.

## 17. Custom domain

`SITE_URL` / `BASE_PATH` come from the environment and the workflow fills them
from `actions/configure-pages`, so no URL is hardcoded. To move to a custom
domain: add `public/CNAME`, set the domain in repository settings, and update
the `Sitemap:` line in `public/robots.txt` by hand.

## 18. Studio legal name

The footer renders "© <year> Skaldforge. All rights reserved." Confirm the
correct legal entity and rights line. `src/components/Footer.astro`.


## Review pass: remaining publication inputs

- Roadmap expansion cards are now disabled. Existing gods and arenas do not verify plans for new roster slots, new arenas, or future technical capacity. Supply approved milestones before re-enabling them.
- Confirm rights to use the supplied PNGTree valknut commercially, including any attribution requirements. The source image is unchanged.
- Contact details and an approved team presentation remain missing. These are the strongest remaining improvements to the Studio page.
